The following notes will aid you in case you're having trouble with the lesson,
but feel free to skip them and continue with the lesson. One you have a broader
context, they will help you put everything together.

### Personal pronouns

Compared to English, Romanian's personal pronouns lack a precise translation
for *it*. When having a subject that you would normally use *it* for, you
can either use demonstrative pronouns (*acesta* (this masc.), *aceea* (that fem.)
etc.), or simply refrain from using a pronoun.

| English           | Romanian    |
|-------------------|-------------|
| I                 | Eu          |
| You               | Tu          |       
| He/She/It         | El/Ea/*N/A* |
| We                | Noi         |
| You (pl.)         | Voi         |
| They (masc./fem.) | Ei/Ele      |

### To be

In Romanian, the subject of any setence has to be in agreement with the verb
representing the action it is performing. This agreement is called **conjugation**
and comes with its own set of rules and exceptions. Below you will find the
conjugation table for *a fi* (to be).

| English               | Romanian        |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| I am                  | Eu **sunt**     |
| You are               | Tu **eşti**     |       
| He/She is             | El/Ea **este**  |
| We are                | Noi **suntem**  |
| You are (pl.)         | Voi **sunteţi** |
| They are (masc./fem.) | Ei/Ele **sunt** |
