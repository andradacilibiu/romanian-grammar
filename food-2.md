### Compund food names

In order to use more complex names of foods that usually require multiple nouns,
you will have to use a preposition. The two most frequent ones when it comes to
food are *de* (of) and *cu* (with).

*de* is used when in English you would normally use nothing, while *cu* is simply
translated from English food named. (usually used in dish names)

| English                | Romanian               |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| cocoa butter           | unt **de** cacao       |
| seawater fish          | pește **de** mare      |
| chicken with soy sauce | pui **cu** sos de soia |

There are some exceptions when one language may have a specialized word whereas
the other will use a compound noun, like *carne de vită* (beef), or even miss the
preposition *de* entirely, like lună plină (full moon).

This will come in handy later, as it applies to most English compund nouns that
are also translated to compund nouns in Romanian.

| toothpaste | pastă de dinți    |
