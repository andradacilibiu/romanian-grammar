### Plural forms by gender

Compared to English, Romanian plural forms have to be acquired when learning
each noun. Nevertheless, the forms are not completely irregular as they roughly
fall into categories, according to their gender:

#### Masculine

| English | Singular         | Plural           | Rule           |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| carrot  | morco**v**       | morco**vi**      | cons. + i      |
| bear    | ur**s**          | ur**și**         | **cons.** + i  |
| lion    | le**u**          | le**i**          | u → i          |
| dog     | câine            | câini            | e → i          |
| horse   | ca**l**          | ca**i**          | vowel + l → i  |

#### Feminine

| English | Singular         | Plural              | Rule           |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| salad   | salat**ă**       | salat**e**          | ă → e          |
| cabbage | varz**ă**        | v**e**rz**e**       | ă → e          |
| evening | sear**ă**        | ser**i**            | ă → i          |
| bear    | ber**e**         | ber**i**            | e → i          |
| book    | cart**e**        | c**ă**r**ți**       | e → i          |
| coffee  | caf**ea**        | caf**ele**          | ea → ele       |
| kitchen | bucătăr**ie**    | bucătăr**ii**       | ie → ii        |

#### Neuter

*Note:* Although Romanian has three genders, the neuter gender usually acts
like a masculine noun when being singular and feminine one when being plural.
If you see rules or tables where neuter is missing (which is probably most of
them), treat neuter nouns as either masculine or feminine depending on their
count.

| English | Singular         | Plural              | Rule           |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| dessert | deser**t**       | deser**turi**       | cons. + uri    |
| message | mesa**j**        | mesa**je**          | cons. + e      |
| menu    | meni**u**        | meni**uri**         | u + ri         |
| tea     | cea**i**         | cea**iuri**         | i + uri        |

### Exceptions

Some examples like **ou** - **ouă** don't fit in any of the rules above and
should simply be remembered. In a similar fashion to English, some uncountable
nouns form plural with the use of compound nouns:

| English         | Singular            | Plural              |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| garlic clove    | cățel de usturoi    | căței de usturoi    |
| pair of glasses | pereche de ochelari | perechi de ochelari |
