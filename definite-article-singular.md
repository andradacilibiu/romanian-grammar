### Definite article - Nominative-Accusative, Singular

One particularity of Romanian is the definite article. Along with a few other languages
like Bulgarian, Macedonian, Norwegian, the definite article gets attached to the end
of the noun. In other words, instead of having it in the beginning like in *__the__ cat*,
Romanian has a specific ending.

The definite article is used to tell that its noun is particular and identifiable by
person listening. (It's not just *a* game, it's **the** game.)

During this lesson we only deal with the nominative-accusative form., with the
dative-genitive form coming in a later lesson.
