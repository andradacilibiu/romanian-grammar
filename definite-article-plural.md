### Definite article - Nominative-Accusative, Plural

During this lesson we only deal with the nominative-accusative form., with the
dative-genitive form coming in a later lesson.

#### Masculine

Masculine plural nouns' definite article is a simple *i* to the end of the
plural form.

* bărbați - bărbați**i** (men - the men)
* vultur - vulturi**i** (eagles - the eagles)

#### Feminine

Feminine plural nouns are just as easy. One only needs to add *le* at the end
of the plural form.

* femei - femei**le** (women - the women)
* super - supe**le** (soups - the soups)
