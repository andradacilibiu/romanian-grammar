### *Salut!*

Romanian culture puts a great emphasis on politeness. Thus, knowing how to greet
is an essential skill for anyone learning the basics.

#### Formal greetings

| English      | Romanian       |
|--------------|----------------|
| Good day     | Bună ziua      |
| Good morning | Bună dimineața |
| Good evening | Bună seara     |
| Good night   | Noapte bună    |
| Good bye     | La revedere    |

#### Less formal greetings

Apart from *salut* (hi), most Romanian informal greetings have higher usage only
in particular regions but are understood by virtually everyone.

Also, some ways of greeting can be use when meeting **and** departing.

| English | Romanian |

| Bye     | Pa       |
| Bye     | Salut    |
