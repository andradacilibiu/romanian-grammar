### *Salut!*

Romanian culture puts a great emphasis on politeness. Thus, knowing how to greet
is an essential skill for anyone learning the basics.

#### Formal greetings

| English      | Romanian       |
|--------------|----------------|
| Good day     | Bună ziua      |
| Good morning | Bună dimineața |
| Good evening | Bună seara     |
| Good night   | Noapte bună    |
| Good bye     | La revedere    |

#### Less formal greetings

Apart from *salut* (hi), most Romanian informal greetings have higher usage only
in particular regions but are understood by virtually everyone.

Also, some ways of greeting can be use when meeting **and** departing.

| English | Romanian |
|---------|----------|
| Hi      | Salut    |
| Hi      | Bună     |
| Hi      | Ciao     |
| Hi      | Servus   |
| Bye     | Pa       |
| Bye     | Salut    |
| Bye     | Ciao     |

### Polite pronouns

Much like in the case of the French language, Romanian has a special politeness pronoun.
If you want to be explicitly polite, you use the following forms.

| English | Usual  | Polite        |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| you     | tu/voi | dumneavoastră |
| he      | el     | dumnealui     |
| she     | ea     | dumneaei      |
| they    | ei/ele | dumnealor     |

This difference also adds more polite forms of some phrases.

| English   | Usual                  | Polite         |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|
| please    | te rog                 | vă rog         |
| thank you | [îți] mulțutmesc/merci | [vă] mulțumesc |
