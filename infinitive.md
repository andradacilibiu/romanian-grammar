### Verb moods

In Romanian, verbs have moods that help a speaker express attitude towards
something. (command, wish, etc.) Two important moods that you will use and should
probably remember are *indicative* and *infinitive*.

Indicative is the default mood use for factual statements and is the most common
one. Compared to English, infinitive is less used in Romanian (it has more
specialized moods instead), but it's very useful in recognizing *conjugation groups*.


### Conjugation groups

All Romanian verbs fall into four conjugation groups which help when conjugating.
Unfortunately, these groups are divided into further groups, but they still help
form four rough conjugation sets of rules that work for all regular verbs with
very minor exceptions.

The four groups are identified by the way verbs end when in the infinitive mood.

| Group | Ending         |
|-------|----------------|
| I     | **a**          |
| II    | **ea**         |
| III   | **e**          |
| IV    | **i** or **î** |

#### Irregular verbs

Irregular verbs have different conjugations that don't fall in the aforementioned
rules, but they are usually learned on the fly as they not many.

A few examples are *a fi* (to be), *a avea* (to have), *a vrea* (to want), *a da*
(to give), *a lua* (to take), *a ști* (to know), *a mânca* (to eat), *a face* (to
do), and a few more.
