### Uncountables

In Romanian, the equivalent of uncountable nouns are the nouns lacking a plural form.
Some exmples would be **lapte**, **miere**, **zahăr** etc. Like in English, these
nouns usually denote substances or concepts that cannot be separated into individual
elements.

When talking about food for example, you should use the singular of nouns lacking
plural form and the plural for all others, as long as the quantity is not known.

| English                             | Romanian                     |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Eu nu mănânc **zahăr** niciodata.   | I never eat sugar.           |
| Ei mănâncă **roșii** în fiecare zi. | They eat tomatoes every day. |

If the quantity is known, you should use the proper from.

| English                          | Romanian                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Noi mănâncăm doi **castraveți**. | We are eating two cucumbers. |
| Voi mănâncați un **tort**.       | You are eating a cake.       |
